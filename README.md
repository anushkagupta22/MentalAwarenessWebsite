# Mental Awareness Website
Mental illnesses are among the most common health conditions in the world.

More than 50% are diagnosed with a mental illness or disorder at some point in their lifetime.
1. 1 in 5 people experiences a mental illness in a given year.
2. 1 in 5 children, either currently or at some point during their life, have had a seriously debilitating mental illness.
3. 1 in 25 people lives with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression.

What causes mental illness?
There is no single cause for mental illness. A number of factors can contribute to risk for mental illness, such as

1. Early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse (for example, child abuse, sexual assault, witnessing violence, etc.)
2. Experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes
3. Biological factors or chemical imbalances in the brain
4. Use of alcohol or drugs
5. Having feelings of loneliness or isolation

MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS! MENTAL HEALTH CAN BE CURED!

Thus, keeping all these things in mind I tried to create a mental awareness website (still working on backend part) to provide support to people suffering from mental health problems who are afraid to come out in public.
