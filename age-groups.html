<h2> AGE SPECIFIC </h2>
<p> Age and gender differences in attitudes keep us from seeking professional psychological help. 
50% of mental health problems are established by age 14 and 75% by age 24. 10% of children and young people (aged 5-16 years) have a clinically diagnosable mental problems, yet 70% of children and adolescents who experience mental health problems have not had appropriate interventions at a sufficiently early age.The goals and traditions of public health and health promotion  should be applied just as usefully in the field of mental health as they have been in the prevention of both infectious and chronic diseases. People do not seek profesional help when they are in psychological distress or suicidal due to   negation related to suicidal thoughts, negative attitudes and biased beliefs about help-seeking and fear of stigma; and facilitators of seeking help, negative past experience, mental health illiteracy, and unsupportive social influences.

<h3>Pre pubescent - young adult
</h3>
  <p>
  There is a high prevalence of mental health problems in Pre pubescent - young adult. Adult mental health disorders begin by adolescence.
 Two-thirds of those with disorder at the age of 15-18 were diagnosed with a mental disorder as an adult. The risk of later disorder for those with disorder in adolescence was high and differed across types of disorder. Findings suggest that to reduce the risk of disorder in early adulthood, clinicians could play a more active role in community  interventions with direct social outcomes. Studies suggest that 49.5% of youth will have had a diagnosable mental illness at some point before they are 18.Although young people receive help from many sources, there remains a considerable unmet need. Combined medication and behavioral treatment would help to improve the mental health in children.

<h3>
    Middle ages
</h3>
  <p>
    Middle-age period is an important phase of life that lies between being young and old. Because of different biological, mental, social, and psychological alterations, middle-aged people are at greater risk for developing mental problems. Middle age is also often associated with changes to family structure, which may be linked with mental health, and rising rates of divorce. Self-care and seeking help enables people living with mental disorders to take the first step in effective prevention and management of their conditions.

<h3>Older 
</h3>
  <p> 
  It is estimated that 20% of people age 55 years or older experience some type of mental health concern . While there are some conditions that the elderly are more prone to, the fact is that psychological or psychiatric conditions can manifest at any age and the key to dealing with them is early diagnosis and effective treatment.Don’t feel ashamed to admit that you’re having difficulty coping, talk to your family and loved ones about your struggles and decide how you can get help. According to the World Health Organisation, dementia, anxiety and depression are the most prevalent mental and neurological conditions in the elderlys. Mental health is associated with distress and suffering , It also can lead to impairments in physical, mental, and social functioning. For those who do need assistance, programs and
services should be accessible and tailored to meet the unique needs of older adults.
