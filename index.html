  <p>Mental Health is IMPORTANT.</p>
  <p1>Did you know? </p1>  
<p2>People with mental disorders are two times more likely to die early than their peers in the general population — and not just because of factors like suicide. Mental Health, it’s connected to nearly all facets of life and is a driving force for how we are able to interact with peers, loved ones, and even strangers. It is also connected to our physical wellbeing, helping us to maintain certain normal functions such as maintaining our immune system and energy levels. 
Mental health issues are nothing to be ashamed of, you didn’t do anything wrong. It can be treated with medication, therapy, counseling and many self help therapy too.
